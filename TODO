16:43 <shachaf> autoscroll broken
17:25 <shachaf> don't display contact input when game is over (or just deactivate all clues when game ends?)
17:49 <shachaf> reset clue ids when starting new game
handle challenge
choosewm
autoscroll sometimes broken
<rbraun> shachaf: *please* add dumping the log of successful clues to the text field <rbraun> as is already done with defused clues
clue stays active if it matches word when game ends
bug: single-letter word makes it impossible for wordmaster to end game
when a word is the result of a successful challenge, it should be added to the "not" list
<gwillen> hmm, shachaf it lets me guess things that are already eliminated
